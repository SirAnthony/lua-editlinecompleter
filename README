Installation
------------

    make

You may well need to edit the Makefile, which has only been tested on
Linux; patches to make it more general are welcome. Install
rlcompleter.lua and rlcompleter_c.so (or equivalent) on LUA_PATH and
LUA_CPATH respectively.


Use
---

require "rlcompleter"

You may want to put this in your LUA_INIT. Then in the interpreter
(which must have been built with LUA_USE_READLINE) you can press Tab
to complete the current identifier.
